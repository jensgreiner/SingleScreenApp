# SingleScreenApp
Final project for lessons 1A and 1B for Udacity course Android Basics

## Build a Single Screen App

### Project Overview
To test your skills from this free course, design and implement a single screen app that displays information about a fictional small business. Think along the lines of your favorite coffeeshop, local restaurant, or that gem of a store that sells those rare comic books or records.

#### Suggested App Ideas
* Details about a small business in your neighborhood
* Contact info and description about your workplace or school
* Info about a special interest group (like a club or sports team) you’re part of and how new members can sign up

#### Requirements
Your design must include:
* Business name
* At least one photo representing the business
* Two or more other pieces of information, such as:
  * Contact information for the business (eg phone number, email address, website)
  * Address of the Business
  * Description of business
  * Hours of operation

**Note**: This is not required but If you’re up for a making real impact in your community, go check out an actual local business and obtain their consent to build an app for them!
